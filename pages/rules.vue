            In Take 5 – originally known as 6 nimmt!, which translates as “6
            Takes!” – your goal is to score the least points. There are 104
            cards numbered 1 to 104. Every card has at least 1 small bullhead on
            it, which score against you, while some cards have several
            bullheads.
          </p>

            Each player gets 10 cards and 4 are dealt face up onto the table to
            form the start of 4 rows. In each round, players choose a card from
            their hand and place it face down in from of them. When everyone is
            ready, players reveal their cards and place them, in ascending
            numerical order, on the ends of the rows according to two simple
            rules:
          </p>

          <p>
            Ascending Order: You must play your card at the end of a row where
            your card is higher than the card at the end of the row. That is the
            numbers in each row must always increase from left to right.
          </p>

          <p>
            Least Difference: In the case where your card is higher than the
            end-card of more than one row, you must play your card after the
            end-card that is closest in value to your card. taking a row taking
            a row
          </p>

          <p>
            As play progresses, the rows get longer. A row with 5 cards in it is
            considered full. If your card would be the 6th, you must take the 5
            cards in the row – hence the name Take 5. Your card then becomes the
            new start card for that row. Should you play a card with a number
            lower than all of the end cards, you must take all of the cards in
            one of the rows. However, you get to choose which row to take.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cards you take do not go in your hand. Instead, you’ll place
            them in a Bull Pile in front of you to score as points at the end of
            the round. The round continues until players have played all 10 of
            their cards. Each player then counts the bullheads on the cards they
            took, scoring 1 point for each. Shuffle the cards, deal 10 to each
            player and play another round. The game ends at the end of the round
            in which at least one player’s score reaches 66 points. The player
            with the lowest score wins the game.

            Take 5 plays fast and is deceptively simple. While it may initially
            seem very luck-based, on repeated plays you’ll discover there is
            some strategy. It’s not just the pure chaos it at first appears to
            be, especially when you’re playing with a full compliment of 10
            players. Lots of laughter… and groans always ensue when you play
            Take 5!
